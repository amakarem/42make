# 42make 🚀

> 🥈 2nd Prize Winner – Make.com x 42 School Hackathon

**42make** is a fully no-code solution built entirely on [Make.com](https://www.make.com), developed during the Make.com & 42 School Hackathon. This project showcases how complex OAuth authentication and API interaction can be achieved without writing a single line of backend code or hosting any web pages.

## 🧠 How It Works

This project leverages **Make.com** webhooks and workflows to act as a full-stack web app using only automation scenarios. Here's how the flow works:

### 1. Initial Webhook (Login Initiation)

- The entry point is a **Make.com webhook**.
- Checks whether the user is already logged in using a session check.
- If **logged in**, the request is routed to the second workflow.
- If **not logged in**, it initiates an **OAuth2 flow** with the 42 API (Intra).
- After successful login, the user is redirected to the **second workflow**.

### 2. Authenticated UI Rendering

- Begins with a webhook that checks the session again.
- If the session is invalid, it redirects the user back to the first workflow.
- If valid, it responds with an **HTML + JavaScript** response directly from Make.com.
- This HTML UI interacts with the 42 API via another Make.com workflow, used as a **proxy** to bypass CORS restrictions.
- based on user request we get the data for intership and user data from 42 API

### 3. Proxy API Communication

- This workflow acts as a **CORS-safe proxy** between the frontend JS and the 42 API.
- Ensures secure, policy-compliant data exchange.

### 4. Internship Application Workflow

- If a user applies for an internship, this workflow:
  - Captures the application data.
  - Creates a new row in a connected **Google Sheet**.

### 5. Post-Application Processing

- This workflow runs on the same Google Sheet.
- Processes applications, adds flags, or sends notifications (custom logic applied here).

### 6. Create Job by partner or staff workflow

- this work the same as Application workflow.
- to test it after login as student in console log run fakeit()
